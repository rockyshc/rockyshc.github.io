Since our team will more focus on Cloud solition, I'm doing many 
reseaches and investigations about Cloud realted topics.Today I forked 
one blog project from mojombo, even I don't really know what the "fork" means.
I have updated the CSS make the pages more better.But I still just use the 
notepad to write sourse code files, I need to make it more easily.And I will 
keep doing many attivites in the future.
Better late than never.
