<p>Since our team will more focus on Cloud solition, I'm doing many reseaches and investigations about Cloud realted topics.</p>
<p>Today I forked one blog project from mojombo, even I don't really know what the "fork" means.</p>
<p>I have updated the CSS make the pages more better.</p>
<p>But I still just use the notepad to write sourse code files, I need to make it more easily.</p>
<p>And I will keep doing many attivites in the future.</p>
<p>Better late than never.</p>
