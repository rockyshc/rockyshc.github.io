When I try to use Git Bash to connect the github server, I meet the "ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: Name or service not known" Issue. After goolge it, I found it should be the DNS problem and I just add Google DNS "8.8.8.8" into my desktop.
Now it's working, so you can see this new post now. LoL.
---But the bad news is my interl connection not working...I post this then change it back...
